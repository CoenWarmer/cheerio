# Removing Config.swift from Git Tracking

## What Was Done

The `Config.swift` file was already committed to the repository, but it shouldn't be since it contains credentials and is auto-generated.

## Steps Taken

1. **Removed from Git tracking** (file still exists locally):

   ```bash
   git rm --cached packages/ios-app/CheeriooApp/Config.swift
   ```

2. **File status**:
   - ✅ Local file: Still exists and works
   - ✅ Git status: Staged for deletion (won't be in future commits)
   - ✅ .gitignore: Already configured to ignore it

## To Complete the Process

Commit this change:

```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove Config.swift from Git tracking

Config.swift is now auto-generated from .env.local and should not be committed.
The file will continue to exist locally but won't be tracked by Git.

- Added to .gitignore
- Template Config.swift.example provided instead
- Developers use 'yarn generate-config' to create their own"
```

## What Happens Next

### For You (Current Developer)

- ✅ Your local `Config.swift` remains untouched
- ✅ It will be ignored by Git from now on
- ✅ Running `yarn generate-config` will continue to work

### For Other Developers (After They Pull)

When they pull your changes:

1. Their `Config.swift` will be deleted (since it's removed from Git)
2. They need to regenerate it:
   ```bash
   cd packages/ios-app
   yarn generate-config
   ```
3. Their new `Config.swift` will be gitignored automatically

## Best Practice: Notify Your Team

Add this to your commit message or PR description:

```markdown
⚠️ **Breaking Change for iOS Developers**

After pulling this commit, you need to regenerate Config.swift:

1. Make sure you have .env.local at repo root (or web-app)
2. Run: `cd packages/ios-app && yarn generate-config`
3. Build project in Xcode

Config.swift is now auto-generated and gitignored.
See packages/ios-app/CONFIG-SETUP.md for details.
```

## Verification

Check that it's working correctly:

```bash
# File exists locally
ls packages/ios-app/CheeriooApp/Config.swift

# Not tracked by Git (should show nothing after commit)
git status packages/ios-app/CheeriooApp/Config.swift

# Ignored by Git
git check-ignore packages/ios-app/CheeriooApp/Config.swift
# Should output: packages/ios-app/CheeriooApp/Config.swift
```

## Template File

The `Config.swift.example` file is committed and serves as:

- ✅ Template for new developers
- ✅ Shows the structure without exposing credentials
- ✅ Safe to commit to Git

## Summary

✅ `Config.swift` removed from Git tracking  
✅ Local file preserved and working  
✅ Template file (`Config.swift.example`) committed  
✅ `.gitignore` configured  
✅ Ready to commit this change

**Next Step**: Commit the staged deletion when you're ready!
