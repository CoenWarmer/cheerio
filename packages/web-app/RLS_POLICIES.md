# Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

## The Issue

If you're getting empty arrays from API routes even though data exists, it's likely because **Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled on your Supabase tables but no policies are configured.

## Quick Fix

Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor to add proper RLS policies:

### 1. Rooms Table Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS on rooms table
ALTER TABLE rooms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anyone to read all rooms
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read rooms" ON rooms
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to create rooms
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create rooms" ON rooms
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = created_by);

-- Allow users to update their own rooms
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own rooms" ON rooms
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = created_by);

-- Allow users to delete their own rooms
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own rooms" ON rooms
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = created_by);
```

### 2. Messages Table Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS on messages table
ALTER TABLE messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anyone to read messages
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read messages" ON messages
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to create messages
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create messages" ON messages
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own messages
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own messages" ON messages
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete (soft delete) their own messages
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own messages" ON messages
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND deleted = false);
```

## Run These in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ðŸ‘‰ **https://app.supabase.com/project/oumenpdjtlflmelorrrj/sql**

2. Copy and paste the SQL above
3. Click "Run" or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`

## What These Policies Do

### Rooms:

- âœ… **Read** - Anyone can view all rooms (public)
- âœ… **Create** - Only authenticated users can create rooms (and they must set themselves as creator)
- âœ… **Update** - Users can only update rooms they created
- âœ… **Delete** - Users can only delete rooms they created

### Messages:

- âœ… **Read** - Anyone can read all messages
- âœ… **Create** - Only authenticated users can send messages (and they must set themselves as sender)
- âœ… **Update** - Users can only update their own messages
- âœ… **Delete** - Users can only soft-delete their own messages

## Alternative: More Restrictive Policies

If you want to make rooms private by default:

```sql
-- Only show non-private rooms OR rooms created by the user
CREATE POLICY "Users see public rooms and own rooms" ON rooms
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    is_private = false
    OR auth.uid() = created_by
  );
```

## Checking Existing Policies

To see what policies exist:

```sql
-- View all policies for rooms table
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'rooms';

-- View all policies for messages table
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'messages';
```

## Removing Old Policies

If you need to remove existing policies:

```sql
-- Drop all policies for rooms
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_name" ON rooms;

-- Drop all policies for messages
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_name" ON messages;
```

## Testing

After adding policies:

1. **Test unauthenticated access:**
   - Open browser in incognito mode
   - Visit `/rooms` - should see public rooms

2. **Test authenticated access:**
   - Sign in
   - Create a new room
   - Should appear in list

3. **Test API routes:**
   - Check browser console for API calls
   - Should return data, not empty arrays

## Debug: Check If RLS Is Enabled

```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('rooms', 'messages');
```

- `rowsecurity = true` means RLS is enabled
- `rowsecurity = false` means RLS is disabled

## Production Recommendation

For production, you should:

1. âœ… Keep RLS enabled
2. âœ… Use specific policies for each operation
3. âœ… Test policies thoroughly
4. âœ… Consider using service role key for admin operations
5. âœ… Add policies for presence and other tables as needed
