# Emoji Markers - Location Storage Update

## Problem

Emoji markers were only visible to the user who sent them, not to other users in the room. This was because:

- Emoji marker locations were looked up from `userLocations` state (most recent location per user)
- When other users joined the room, they only saw each user's **current** location, not where they were when they sent the emoji
- Historical emoji locations were lost

## Solution

Store the user's location **with the message** when it's sent, making emoji markers permanent and visible to all users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema

- **File**: `migrations/add-location-to-messages.sql`
- **Action**: Added `location JSONB` column to `messages` table
- **Format**: `{ "lat": number, "long": number }`
- **Run**: Execute this migration in Supabase SQL editor

### 2. API Route (`/api/rooms/[slug]/messages`)

- **File**: `src/app/api/rooms/[slug]/messages/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Accept optional `location` field in POST body
  - Store location with message in database

### 3. API Client

- **File**: `src/lib/api-client.ts`
- **Changes**: Updated `messagesApi.create()` signature to accept optional `location` field

### 4. ChatSidebar Component

- **File**: `src/components/ChatSidebar.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `currentUserLocation` prop (passed from parent)
  - Added `isEmoji()` helper function
  - When sending an emoji message, include `location` if user is tracking

### 5. Room Page

- **File**: `src/app/room/[slug]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `EmojiMarker` interface: `location` is now `{ lat: number; long: number }`
  - Pass current user's location to `ChatSidebar` component
  - **Initial load**: Read emoji locations from `message.location` field
  - **Real-time**: Read emoji locations from message payload's `location` field
  - Removed dependency on `userLocations` for emoji markers

## How It Works Now

### Sending an Emoji

1. User types an emoji in chat (e.g., ðŸŽ‰)
2. `ChatSidebar` detects it's an emoji using regex
3. If user is tracking (has a location), include location with message
4. Message saved to database with `location: { lat: number, long: number }`

### Viewing Emoji Markers

1. **On page load**:
   - Fetch all messages from room
   - Filter for emoji messages (single emoji only)
   - Check if message has a `location` field
   - Create marker at stored location

2. **Real-time**:
   - Listen for new message inserts
   - If emoji + has location â†’ add marker
   - All users in room see the marker immediately

### Benefits

âœ… Emoji markers are permanent (stored in database)  
âœ… Visible to all users, not just sender  
âœ… Historical accuracy (shows where user was when sent)  
âœ… No dependency on current tracking status  
âœ… Simplified logic (no timestamp matching needed)

## Migration Steps

1. **Run the migration**:

   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Copy and paste contents of migrations/add-location-to-messages.sql
   ```

2. **Regenerate TypeScript types**:

   ```bash
   cd packages/web-app
   yarn supabase:types
   ```

3. **Test**:
   - User A (tracker): Start tracking, send emoji â†’ should see marker
   - User B (supporter): Join room â†’ should see User A's emoji marker
   - User B: Send emoji (not tracking) â†’ no marker
   - User A: Stop tracking, send emoji â†’ no marker

## Notes

- Any user who is actively tracking can create emoji markers (location required)
- Only single emojis sent while tracking get markers
- All users can see all emoji markers in the room
- Emoji detection uses Unicode regex for accurate matching
- Supporters normally cannot track (UI hides tracking button), so they typically cannot create markers
