# Web App Environment Configuration
# 
# NOTE: This package uses a symlink to the repo root's .env.local file
# Please create your .env.local file in the REPO ROOT (../../.env.local)
# Copy from: ../../.env.local.example
#
# The symlink is already created at: packages/web-app/.env.local -> ../../.env.local
#
# This centralized approach allows both the web-app and iOS app 
# to share the same environment configuration.
